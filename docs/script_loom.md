# 90-Second Demo Script

**0:00 - 0:10 (Intro)**
"Hi, I'm Hari. We've all been in meetings where decisions get lost. Today I'm showing you **Decision-Minutes Copilot**—an AI tool that turns chaotic transcripts into structured action items."

**0:10 - 0:30 (The Problem & Solution)**
"Most summarizers just give you a wall of text. My tool uses a specialized extraction pipeline to find exactly **Who** needs to do **What** by **When**."

**0:30 - 0:60 (Live Demo)**
*Action: Switch to the App UI*
"Let's paste a messy transcript involving a database migration. I click 'Extract Insights'..."
*Action: Wait for result*
"Boom. In seconds, we see:
1.  **Decision**: Migrate to Postgres.
2.  **Action Item**: Sarah provisions the server (High Confidence).
3.  **Metrics**: We just saved an estimated 15 minutes of manual note clean-up."

**0:60 - 0:80 (Architecture)**
"Under the hood, this runs on a Node.js backend using Google Gemini. It enforces strict JSON schemas so you never get broken data."

**0:80 - 0:90 (Outro)**
"This is just the MVP. Next, I'm adding Jira integration. Thanks for watching!"
